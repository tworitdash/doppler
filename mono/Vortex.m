%% Code for predicting performance of a thin aerofoil in unsteady flow
%This example is a simple 2D aerfoil in unsteady flow modelled using lumped
%vortex elements. The singularities associated with ideal irrotational
%vortices are bypassed by the introduction of the Lamb-Oseen vortex core
%model (see Wiki for more details).

    %For a single lumped vortex representation of an aerofoil, equation
    %13.118 reduces to a simple expression in which the 'a' matrix is just
    %a 2-by-2 matrix of the following form:
    
    % a = a_11 a_1W
    %       1    1
    
    %The column vector of unknowns is just [gamma_1,gamma_w_i]^T. The RHS
    %is jused [RHS1,RHS2]^T. Matrix inversion of a 2-by-2 matrix does not
    %even require Matlab \ command. The inverse of the 'a' matrix is just
    
    % a^{-1} = 1/(a_11 - a_1W)*[1, -a_1W; -1, a_11]
    
    %Note - although this is a 'pure' model, it is quite possible to
    %upgrade it to a LLT model. To do so, you simply need to recognise that
    %the effective angle of attack (taking into account both kinematic and
    %wake-induced velocities) is known, and then you simply go to a lookup
    %table to get the lift and drag. Then by the Kutta-Joukowski theorem,
    %you calculate the strength of the shed vortex and feed that into the
    %wake. Using lookup tables does, however, have its own issues. For
    %example, the use of lookup tables may be a source of error in
    %curvilinear flow or when a wing/blade is of finite length.
